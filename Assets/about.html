    <p style="color: blue;">
        Hi there! I'm Gaurav, a research student 
        who has a quest to learn many new things and 
        is eager to explore new places. I am pursuing my 
        research under a joint doctoral program between
         Universitat Rovira I Virgili Tarragona, Spain, 
         and the Indian Institute of Information Technology
          Allahabad, India. Currently, I am living in Sitges, 
          Barcelona, Spain. My primary work is to predict 
          human motion using deep sequential architecture. 
          My secondary work is focused on improving the 
          quality of life of people with intellectual and 
          developmental disabilities. I am excited to enhance 
          my professional expertise and skills to work 
          managing projects through creative problem 
          solving and inventive thinking.
